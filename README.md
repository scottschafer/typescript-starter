### Requirement Node 6+ && NPM 3+
This generator is targeted to be used with Node >= 6.0.0 and NPM => 3.0.0. You can check your version number with the command

```

### Install

##### Install required tools
```
npm install
```

### Run
```
gulp serve
```

##### Run `yo fountain-webapp`, and select desired technologies:
```
yo fountain-webapp
```
#### Use NPM scripts

- `npm run build` to build an optimized version of your application in /dist
- `npm run serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
- `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
- `npm run test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
- `npm run test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode

#### Or Gulp tasks

If you have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global packages you can use equivalent:

- `gulp` or `gulp build`
- `gulp serve`
- `gulp serve:dist`
- `gulp test`
- `gulp test:auto`

**If you don't have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global, you should have this error:**
> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js:121
    gulpInst.start.apply(gulpInst, toRun);
TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined

To fix, run:

- `npm install -g gulp-cli`
